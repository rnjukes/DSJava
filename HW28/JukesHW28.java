 *  AT Java HW 28 Part A + B
 * 
 *  Part A
 *  In the context of snakes, crocodiles, reptiles, and turtles, reptiles are the superclass. It is the most
 *  general class amoung them all. All of the other options are reptiles, but for example, not all reptiles are
 *  snakes, making reptiles the superclass among the options available. 
 * 
 *  Part B
 *  AcousticGuitar ag; and ElectricGuitar eg; are subclasses of Guitar, so they can be passed. Guitar myGuitar; is 
 *  expected and can be passed as well. Instrument myInstrument; cannot be passed because it is the superclass of 
 *  Guitar, and as we learned in class, it would not be able to be passed going the wrong direction logically.
