/*
 * 
 *  Q1 - A
 *  This option will make a compilation error occur because it tries to make an object
 *  of the type Resizable, however this is not possible because interfaces only define
 *  methods in this context.
 * 
 *  Q2 - B
 *  Methods used from the Circle class will produce compilation errors in this instance, 
 *  therefore only B can function with no errors seeing as it doesn't access said class
 *  like the other options do.
